### - Partnership with U.S. Accelerator to Accelerate Global Expansion in Manufacturing ###

We are pleased to announce that zeteoh Inc. has been selected for the Global Startup Acceleration Program (GSAP), hosted by the Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO).

■ About the Program

The GSAP is a program jointly implemented by JETRO and the Cabinet Office of Japan to support the global expansion of Japanese startups. We were chosen as one of 50 companies for the second cohort, specifically for the "ManufacturingTech & HardTech" track.

This track is run in partnership with "industry4.0," an accelerator based in Illinois, USA. The program offers specialized mentorship and networking opportunities focused on the manufacturing sector. By leveraging advice from experts with decades of experience and strong connections with major manufacturers and investors, we expect to accelerate our business validation and market entry into overseas markets.

■ Future Outlook

Through this program, zeteoh will actively pursue the global expansion of its manufacturing solutions, which are powered by our core indoor positioning technology.

Our participation in the GSAP marks a critical step in our global journey. We look forward to deepening our partnerships both in Japan and internationally as we work toward building a better society.

We sincerely appreciate your continued support.
