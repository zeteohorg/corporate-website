### - To Help Manufacturing Operations Managers Locate Critical Workers Globally ###

zeteoh Inc. is pleased to announce its selection for the Global Startup Acceleration Program (GSAP), hosted by the Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO).

■ Addressing Key Challenges in Manufacturing

Manufacturing operations managers face a critical challenge: a lack of visibility into the location of their key personnel within large facilities. This leads to a decline in productivity and compromises safety management.

zeteoh addresses this problem with our innovative smartphone-enabled system that accurately locates anyone in a facility. This technology helps managers ensure worker safety and boost overall productivity.

■ Expanding into Global Markets

The GSAP is a program jointly implemented by JETRO and the Cabinet Office of Japan to support the global expansion of Japanese startups. zeteoh was chosen as one of 50 companies for the second cohort, specifically for the "ManufacturingTech & HardTech" track.

This track is run in partnership with "industry4.0," an accelerator based in Illinois, USA. By leveraging specialized mentorship from experts with decades of experience and strong connections with major manufacturers and investors, zeteoh aims to accelerate its business validation and market entry into overseas markets.

■ Our Future Outlook

Through the GSAP, zeteoh will actively pursue the global expansion of our indoor positioning technology, "TRAILS."

Our participation in this program is a significant step in our global journey. We look forward to deepening our partnerships both in Japan and internationally as we work toward solving the critical challenges faced by manufacturing operations managers worldwide.

We sincerely appreciate your continued support.
