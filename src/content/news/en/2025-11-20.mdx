We will be exhibiting at the "Tokyo International Industry Exhibition 2025," held at Tokyo Big Sight from Wednesday, November 26th to Friday, November 28th, 2025.

Our participation was made possible with the support of **the Tokyo Metropolitan Government’s "Tokyo NEXT 5G Boosters Project**," an initiative supporting startups utilizing next-generation communication technology.

**🚀 zeteoh Product Introduction: Spatial AI Platform "TRAILS"**

zeteoh will be showcasing **"TRAILS," the Spatial AI platform that transforms workflow analysis in manufacturing facilities and dramatically improves productivity**.

Material movers in factories walk an average of 19km per shift, with **30% of that distance being wasted motion (searching, U-turns, etc.)**, which leads to an annual cost increase of ¥12–18M.

TRAILS achieves **infrastructure-free indoor positioning technology using only a smartphone**. It accurately measures and analyzes the workers' movement and inefficient routes, reducing wasted motion **within days, not months**.

**📍 Overview**

**Dates**： November 26 (Wed) – 28 (Fri), 2025

**Time**： 10:00 – 17:00

**Venue**： Tokyo Big Sight, West Exhibition Hall

**Booth**： Startup Zone S-09

We sincerely look forward to welcoming strategic business partners and investors at our booth.
