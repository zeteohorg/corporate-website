CEATEC 2023, a highly anticipated event that ran from October 17th to the 20th for four exciting days, has officially concluded. We're thrilled to report that our booth saw a remarkable turnout, with around 350 visitors.

During CEATEC 2023, we had the fantastic opportunity to directly engage with numerous customers, discussing indoor positioning challenges and needs. We express our heartfelt gratitude for the valuable feedback we received. Additionally, the event opened doors to new business prospects, making it an incredibly enriching exhibition.

Looking ahead to the upcoming release of "TRAILS" in February next year, we're intensifying our efforts in its development. Our commitment to delivering top-notch products to meet your needs remains unwavering. Stay tuned for what's in store!
