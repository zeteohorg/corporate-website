Zeteoh Inc. participated in "4YFN (4 Years From Now)," Europe's largest startup event held in Barcelona, Spain, from February 28 to March 3, 2022, as an exhibitor in the Japan Pavilion organized by the Japan External Trade Organization (JETRO).

#### ■ About 4YFN

4YFN is a startup event held alongside the "Mobile World Congress," one of the world's largest mobile industry events in Barcelona, Spain.
The event aims to showcase startups expected to grow significantly over the next four years, with participants anticipated to demonstrate rapid growth and attract substantial interest and investment.

On February 27, the day before 4YFN opened, a media event called "ShowStoppers" was held, gathering media representatives from various countries.

#### ■ Our Experience at 4YFN

Zeteoh provides AI-powered physical activity auto-tracking technology that enhances the user experience (UX) of health management apps while enabling reliable data collection.
At our booth, many visitors and app developers experienced our physical activity auto-tracking technology through our demonstration app.

Additionally, our CEO Le Guilly delivered a pitch at the "Japan Innovation Showcase," a pitch session organized by JETRO within the 4YFN venue.

We had valuable conversations with various companies, including those seeking solutions for corporate well-being challenges and those looking to improve their app's UX. We received numerous inquiries following the event.
The five-day experience helped us recognize the potential of our solutions not only in Japan but also in international markets.
