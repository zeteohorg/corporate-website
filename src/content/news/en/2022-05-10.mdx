Our COO Le Guilly presented at the pitch event "Wellbeing Startup Pitch for Healthy and Enriched Lives," co-organized with Scrum Studio Inc., a company specializing in creating new business opportunities between Japanese companies and global startups.

As a startup challenging the wellbeing business sector, we introduced Zeteoh's vision of connecting mobile gaming with healthcare. We thank everyone who attended the presentation.
