We are pleased to announce that our company has been selected for the prestigious J-StarX Entrepreneur Dispatch Program - Europe Long-term Program (France) organized by JETRO (Japan External Trade Organization), and participated in the program from May to July 2025. This selection and participation represents a significant milestone in our global expansion strategy.

### Program Overview

From May to July 2025, we participated in an intensive two-month program at Station F in Paris, supported by HEC Paris, one of Europe's premier business schools.

Through this program, we focused on the following strategic objectives:

1. European Investment Ecosystem Engagement
   We engaged with European investors to explore funding opportunities and established our presence in the European investment landscape.
2. Strategic Network Development
   We built a comprehensive network of industry contacts, potential partners, and technology collaborators across European markets.
3. Market-Specific Customer Acquisition
   We identified and pursued potential customers in transportation, manufacturing, and defense sectors with tailored European market value propositions.

Through our selection and participation in this program, we have successfully built a crucial foundation for business expansion in the European market. We will leverage the extensive knowledge and networks gained through this two-month program to accelerate our future global expansion.
