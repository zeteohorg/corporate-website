### Contributing to Indoor Positioning Technology

Ylias joined our indoor positioning technology development team, working on a deep learning algorithm that utilizes smartphone motion sensors and floor plan data. The initial algorithm he developed has been successfully used in investor demonstrations and customer presentations, achieving significant results.

### Applying Academic Theory to Real-World Practice

"At university, I learned the theory, but at zeteoh, I had the opportunity to tackle real challenges," says Ylias. Under the guidance of our machine learning engineers, he acquired practical skills in programming and AI development. He also mastered team development methods using GitHub and learned how to read and share research papers - comprehensive skills essential for an engineer.

### Business Experience Beyond Technical Development

Beyond technical development, Ylias also gained business exposure when he helped represent our company at CEATEC 2025, engaging with potential customers at our exhibition booth. "Witnessing firsthand how startups raise funds and understand customer needs was an incredibly valuable learning experience," he notes, highlighting the business insights he gained.

### Future Career Path

Currently on a gap year, Ylias states, "My experience at zeteoh is a significant asset for my career. Being able to demonstrate achievements in actual projects has opened doors for my next steps."

### Life in Tokyo

"The appeal of Tokyo is its diversity. There are neighborhoods catering to every hobby and interest, providing wonderful experiences," he shares about his fulfilling life in Japan. Ylias also enjoyed traveling to Kyoto and Okinawa while balancing work through the flexibility of remote working options.

Our company continues to actively welcome motivated student interns, contributing to the development of talent with a global perspective. ðŸš€
