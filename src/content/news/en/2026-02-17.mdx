**We will showcase "TRAILS," our infrastructure-free Spatial AI platform, at the Tokyo NEXT 5G Boosters Demo Day on February 20, 2026.** 

In modern manufacturing, up to **30%** of movement is classified as waste, such as walking suboptimal paths or searching for tools. For a facility with 100 staff, this results in an annual loss of approximately **¥165 million **.

To address this, zeteoh provides **"TRAILS,"** a Spatial AI platform that requires **zero CAPEX** and no additional infrastructure like beacons or cameras.

### Key Features of TRAILS
* **Objective Bottleneck Identification**: Extract data by role, area, and time to objectively identify operational bottlenecks.
* **Practical Data Utilization**: Achieve **1-2m** positioning accuracy using only standard smartphones, providing high-quality data for process improvement and safety.
* **Role & Team Optimization**: Instead of tracking individuals, we visualize workflows by role and team to enhance overall productivity and safety.

At the Demo Day, visitors can experience our live dashboard and patented Spatial AI positioning architecture.
