### ◻️ Background

The inspiration for Zeteoh's indoor location system comes from a tragic event in Shizuoka, Japan. A factory fire there led to the loss of firefighters and police officers, who could not be located inside the building.This incident spurred us to develop our technology. Initially intended for emergency services like those in Shizuoka, it soon became apparent that our solution could greatly benefit businesses in improving their operational efficiency.

◻️ Market Research Insights

Our market research identified the first critical challenge for increasing efficiency: the friction related to indoor location tracking. Traditional systems often rely on beacons, which can be complex and require high maintenance.Our MVP (Minimum Viable Product) is designed to overcome these limitations. We aim to provide our customers with a hassle-free way to collect reliable and actionable data.

### ◻️ Mission

We empower businesses and organizations to unlock new levels of operational efficiency.

### ◻️ Comment from the Co-founders

We've received an overwhelming response, with over 20 companies joining our waiting list. This and hundreds of leads signal a strong market demand for productivity enhancements. Our technology, currently in the proof-of-concept stage with select clients, is set to remove the barriers to operational efficiency automation.

### ◻️ The funding

Our pre-seed funding round, led exclusively by Shizen Capital LLC, has been a milestone event for Zeteoh Inc. With this successful fundraising, we're set to release our MVP and lay solid foundations for our company's future.
