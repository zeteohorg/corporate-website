We had a fantastic experience exhibiting at the SusHi Tech Tokyo 2024 Global Startup Program, and we're thrilled by the great turnout at our booth.

The event was truly global, bringing together more than 400 startups and 300 VCs and investors from over 40 countries and cities. As a platform for creating sustainable innovation, it provided an incredible opportunity to showcase groundbreaking ideas and technologies from around the world. We're pleased that our exhibition received significant attention among this diverse international audience.

The networking opportunities were invaluable, as we engaged with investors and companies from both Japan and abroad. These conversations provided crucial insights that will shape our global expansion strategy.

This experience has equipped us with fresh international perspectives and valuable connections that will drive our development of innovative and sustainable solutions.

We're excited about the road ahead and look forward to sharing our progress with you.
