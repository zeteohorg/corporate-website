#### ■ Three Key Features of Our Technology

1. Automatic Detection of Daily Physical Activities
   Automatically detects walking, running, cycling, and stair climbing using a smartphone.

2. No Additional Hardware Required Beyond Smartphones
   No need to purchase additional hardware such as smartwatches.

3. Cheat Detection
   Automatically detects cheating attempts, such as shaking the smartphone to artificially increase step counts.

#### ■ Market Need

The life insurance business model is transitioning towards proposing healthy lifestyles and managing customer risks. However, current technologies limit such initiatives. Not everyone can afford expensive smartwatches to access these services. By utilizing smartphones for maintaining customer health, insurance companies can provide more accessible and convenient insurance services, thereby expanding their market reach.
