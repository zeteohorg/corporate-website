### Zeteoh Selected as a "Deep Tech Pioneer" by Hello Tomorrow—the World’s Most Prestigious Deep Tech Startup Award.

We are proud to announce that Zeteoh has been recognized as a Deep Tech Pioneer by Hello Tomorrow, standing out among more than 4,800 applications from 108 countries. This prestigious recognition highlights our mission to transform the world through industrial innovation.

**Why "Spatial AI" Now?**

While Large Language Models (LLMs) and Visual AI have evolved rapidly to transform office productivity, digitizing "human movement" and "operational workflows" in physical space remains the last and greatest frontier for autonomous industries.

Zeteoh has patented the foundation technology for Spatial AI, an artificial intelligence trained on physical operational data to understand and predict real-time dynamics on the shop floor. Through our platform "TRAILS," we solve this uncharted challenge by reducing infrastructure investment by 90% and enabling immediate deployment using only standard smartphones. Our goal is to maximize productivity in manufacturing environments by turning physical activities into actionable digital intelligence.

"Bringing Intelligence to the Physical World" —Zeteoh is set to transform the future of global manufacturing, starting right here in Japan.
